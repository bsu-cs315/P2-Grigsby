## Project Report
### Reflection
This was hard to do in one week.  I did come up with some good ideas of juice, though.  Most notable were the two I used for the victory screen: the player character dancing using the climbing and ducking sprites, and the color-changing text.  I came up with the dancing and color changing on my own because I thought it would be a good look for a victory screen.  I also used a tween on the title screen, which I did because we did it with the previous project.  I think I should get an A.
