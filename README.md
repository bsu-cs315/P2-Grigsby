## Project Report
### Reflection
This is the project I've been waiting for.  I've always like platformers, so it's nice to get to try to make a simple one myself.  I couldn't figure out parallax scrolling, but I know that it probably isn't too complicated to implement.  My favorite part so far is getting the camera to work.  It's so simple to add a camera node to the player, but also so rewarding for me to see that I can actually follow the character instead of having the camera locked in place.  According to the checklist, I should get an A.
